## Open the Project in VS Code

Make sure the server.js file is inside a folder. 
Open that folder in VS Code.

#2. Install Node.js (if not already installed)

Check if Node.js is installed:
Open a terminal in VS Code and type:

#bash
node -v
If you get a version number, you're good. Otherwise, download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org.

3. Initialize a Node Project (if needed)
In the terminal:

#bash
npm init -y
4. Install Required Packages
Your app uses express and cors, so install them:

#bash

npm install express cors

5. Run the Server
In the terminal, run:

#bash
node server.js

If everything is correct, you'll see:

Server running on http://localhost:3000
